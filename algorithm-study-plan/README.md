# :gear: Algorithm study plan

This README contains some pointers that I've gotten through refreshing leetcode questions. It's been a while, so I'm very rusty and starting from more fundamental, easy questions.

### 189 - Rotate Array

Be aware of the naive implementation I've used. Possible algorithms include cycle detection and reversing the whole array, then reversing 2 subarrays depending on the number of elements rotated.

### 283 - Move Zeros

Last seen non-zero is better than Last seen zero! We don't know whether there is a zero at the end, after all.

### 564 - Permutation in String

Normal question, but the choice of arrays makes this simpler compared to a dictionary

### 733 - Flood Fill (Solved using BFS)

Nothing much, but never to add visited nodes so that bfs will never over-processed visited node again!
