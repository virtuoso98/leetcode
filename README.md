## :wrench: Leetcode Diaries

This repository is dedicated to my journey towards doing well in technical interviews. Right now, I mainly practice Leetcode Interview Questions as I feel that the questions inside are the most practical in getting an internship. However, this might all change in the future!

## :clock130: Future
Right now, I do my questions in Python. In the future, I'd like to try two things out:
* Do Interview questions in C++
* Start on other algorithmic books
* (Bonus!) Competitive Programming in NUS
